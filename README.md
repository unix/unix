## Witt

Hello, I'm Witt (Chinese name: *zhendong.li*) -- A JavaScript full-stack engineer,
I'm creating apps and libs to help improve the developer experience. currently a freelancer.

I'm not working full-time on open source right now, but I still spend a lot of time creating and maintaining OSS projects.
Any sponsorship from the community will greatly inspire me, thanks to everyone.

## Styles

Programming is the most important part of my life, the rest of the time consists mainly of vinyl records, games, and reading.
I'm also a big fan of *Kojima Hideo* and *Miyazaki Hidetaka*, I really benefited from their wild ideas in the games.

ðŸŽ® I'll try if you recommend any video games, movies or books to me,
send me a direct message on Twitter([@echo_witt](https://twitter.com/echo_witt)) or email me at `unix.bio@gmail.com`.
